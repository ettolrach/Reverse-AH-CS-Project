# Reverse!

An othello clone written in Python using PyGame.

## Requirements

To run the game, please have Python 3 and PyGame installed. Though older version would possibly work, only the latest stable versions (at the time of writing Python 3.8.6 64-bit and PyGame 2.0) were tested.

## Usage

Run reverso.py by opening the directory in a terminal and running `python reverso.py`.
